DeZend source code
======
Sorry, this is a late source code of the DeZend system. This project originated in 2006, when I was still working at the World Business Network.

The author of the system is Luo Min, a senior C/C++ and assembly engineer. This DeZend system is the first project of our little Luo after joining the World Business Network. However, because the basic purpose of the system had been achieved at that time, the project was not maintained further.

There are many sayings on the Internet that this DeZend system originated from the Russians, but this is not the case. At that time, due to negligence, an IPB vulnerability caused the server administrator's authority to be broken, so the binary version of this system was leaked, but the Russian version was no longer updated, because the SVN of the source code at that time was in a closed intranet environment, and the source code version had never been saved on the server, so the source code has not been made public until now.

Since Xiaoxiao Luo is not familiar with Linux system, the system is developed based on VC6 and Windows environment. Because it is highly dependent on some MFC codes, it is difficult to port the code to Nix-like systems. Interested friends can try porting. However, the binary versions released outside have basically met most of the needs. With the first release of the binary version of the DeZend system and the subsequent active release of two versions of the binary version, there are now few PHP codes using Zend encryption.

Today, I saw a netizen asking for DeZend code on a forum I often hang out on, and then I remembered that I had never released the source code of the system. After looking for 6 hard drives and 2 stock Thinkpads, I finally found the source code and published it to GitHub to prevent the source code from being lost accidentally.
